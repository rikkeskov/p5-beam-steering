%A preface is your opportunity to inform your audience about your experiences during the writing of your thesis or dissertation.

%A preface is much more personal than other types of academic writing. It is written mainly in the first person and is one of the few places where using first-person is considered acceptable. Your preface is typically written upon completion of your thesis or dissertation, as a final step.

% The following items can be included in the preface:

%     Your (brief) personal background
%     Any (brief) personal experiences or circumstances that motivated you to pursue this type of academic work
%     The target group for which your thesis or dissertation was written
%     Your name, the place name, and the date at the time of writing, at the end of the preface

% While itâ€™s common practice to briefly acknowledge any individuals and/or institutions who have helped you during your writing and editing process, these should mostly be saved for your acknowledgements section.

% Indeed, it is often common practice to write either a preface or an acknowledgements section, not both.

\noindent The project includes source code that is available on \textit{Github}. The link to the \textit{Github} repository can be found in appendix \ref{a:code} while some of the source code is explained in the implementation chapter \ref{ch:implementation}. The repository also contains the test result logs, which are also found in a condensed form in the accept test results in section \ref{s:accept_test}.
