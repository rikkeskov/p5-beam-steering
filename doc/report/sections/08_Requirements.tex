The purpose of this project is to develop a setup where a receiving antenna on a moving platform is able to detect a transmitting antenna at a abitrary point in space and testing this setup. Detection of radio waves can for example be used for intruder detection or can be further developed to include data transmission and thereby achieving higher troughput if the transmitting antenna is able to locate and focus on the receiving device. 

Expanding on these two scenarios, the receiving antenna must be able to be controlled ie. steered in any direction and the electromagnetic radiation in the area must be read. Further, if the receiving antenna should be able to focus on the transmitting antenna for future data communication the receiving
